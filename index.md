    Hi! I am Nikos. I have recently completed my PhD in Stanford's Statistics department, advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~swager">Stefan Wager</a>. In July 2023, I will be joining the University of Chicago as an assistant professor in the <a href="https://stat.uchicago.edu/"> Department of Statistics</a> and the <a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/"> Data Science Institute</a>, after spending a year as a postdoc at <a href="http://stat.columbia.edu/"> Columbia Statistics</a>. 
    </>
    <p>
    I am interested in empirical Bayes methods, causal inference, multiple testing and statistical analysis in the presence of contextual side information, and my research often draws upon nonparametrics and convex optimization. 
    </>
    <p> 
    Previously, I received degrees in Mathematics (BSc), Molecular Biotechnology (BSc) and Scientific Computing (MSc) at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. There, I worked with <a href="https://www.huber.embl.de/"> Wolfgang Huber </a> at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory.
