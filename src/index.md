    Hi! I am Nikos, a third year PhD student at Stanford's Statistics department, advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~swager">Stefan Wager</a>. I am interested in empirical Bayes and multiple testing methods in the presence of contextual side information, often drawing upon nonparametrics and convex optimization.
    </>
    <p> Before coming to Stanford, I received degrees in Mathematics (BSc), Molecular Biotechnology (BSc) and Scientific Computing (MSc) at the University of Heidelberg in Germany. There, I worked with <a href="https://www.huber.embl.de/"> Wolfgang Huber </a> at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory.
