## Lecture Notes

* **Lecture notes on empirical Bayes.** These are available [here](/assets/lecture_notes/Statistics-GR8201-Spring-2023.pdf).
These lecture notes accompanied the course GR8201, “Topics in Theoretical Statistics: Empirical Bayes” that was taught at the Department of Statistics, Columbia University in Spring 2023 together with [Bodhisattva Sen](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~bodhi/Bodhi/Welcome.html).
These lecture notes are preliminary (not polished/carefully proofread at this point) and we would welcome any feedback on them!
